This is the OPELM Toolbox v1.1

Following are the functions to be used by the user:

* gui_OPELM

        This is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for using the 
	following functions. Recommended for typical use of the
	toolbox.


* function [model]=train_OPELM(data,kernel,maxneur,problem,normal,KM)

	This function trains a model using OPELM and the proper inputs


* function [yh,error]=sim_OPELM(model,data)
  
        This function uses the computed model on a test dataset


* function myinputs=LARS_Selection_OPELM(data,kernel,maxneur,problem,normal)	

	This function uses the LARS algorithm with OPELM algorithm


* function myinputs=FB_OPELM(data,input_init,kernel,maxneur,problem,normal)

	This function uses the Forward-Backward algorithm with OPELM algorithm


* function show_model( model )

	This function displays the main content of a computed model 


Typical data is provided in mydata1.mat for playing around with the toolbox basic features.

	
Please read the function's documentation and use the gui otherwise !

Have fun.
